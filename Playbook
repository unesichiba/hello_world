In this lab, we are using Ansible as our deployment tool. There are many other ways to deploy Kubernetes resources including Helm Charts, but I thought Ansible is a much easier option. Ansible uses playbooks to organize its instructions. Our playbook.yml file looks as follows:

- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - name: Deploy the service
    k8s:
      state: present
      definition: ""
      validate_certs: no
      namespace: default
  - name: Deploy the application
    k8s:
      state: present
      validate_certs: no
      namespace: default
      definition: ""
